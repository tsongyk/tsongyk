About Me:

Hi, I'm Tommy! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate developer with a knack for solving problems through code and creativity. With a strong foundation in Java and SwiftUI, I enjoy building projects that blend functionality and innovation, from automation scripts to accessible tech solutions.

During my time as a Test Automation Intern, I honed my skills in quality assurance and automation, and now I'm on a mission to make technology more inclusiveâ€”especially for the deaf community. I'm always eager to learn new things, experiment with fresh ideas, and contribute to open-source projects that make a positive impact.

When I'm not coding, you can find me in the Dorsey Lecture Hall at Luddy, exploring the latest trends in tech, or playing a challenging game of chess.

Let's connect, collaborate, and create something awesome! ðŸ’»âœ¨
